                    <p>
                        Manual scavenging, an inhumane activity, continues to exist across the world
                        despite strict laws. In India, hundreds of people lose their lives every year
                        due to manual scavenging, with Tamil Nadu ranking second in these incidents.
                        Most deaths occur due to inhalation of poisonous gases from manholes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our mission is to eliminate this cruelty through engineering innovation.
                        Under the Indian Government’s <strong>Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge (Nov 20, 2020)</strong>,
                        Team ScavengeX is working towards converting manholes into machine-operated systems.

                    <p>
                        The solution is an advanced semi-automatic robotic system capable of cleaning
                        both horizontal and vertical sewer lines without any human intervention.
                        The system integrates state-of-the-art mechanical mechanisms, intelligent robot
                        path planning and control algorithms, and first-in-segment applications of
                        image processing and machine learning for extreme operational conditions.

                        We aim to achieve <strong>90% product localization</strong>, significantly reducing costs
                        and making the technology accessible to underserved regions of the country.
                        This initiative transforms manual scavengers into trained machine operators,
                        safeguarding lives while improving sanitation standards.

                            Our flagship product, <strong>ScavengeX</strong>, is a semi-automatic robotic system designed
                            to convert manholes into machine-operated cleaning units, inspired by the
                            Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge.

                            Our work spans four core engineering domains:
                            <strong>Mechanical Design, Materials Science, Electronics and Instrumentation,
                            and Robotics Engineering</strong>.

                    <p class='underline font-bold'>ScavengeX – System Overview</p>

                    <p>
                        ScavengeX consists of two major components:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Standing Unit:</strong> Provides structural support and assists operational control
                            for the cleaning process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Drone Unit:</strong> Enters the manhole, inspects for blockages, and performs cleaning
                            operations without any human involvement.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Vertical sewer cleaning is achieved using a specialized bucket-like mechanism,
                        while horizontal sewer lines are cleaned using a dedicated <strong>Rover Unit</strong>.
                        This enables complete manhole cleaning from any point within the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By upgrading manual scavengers into skilled machine operators, ScavengeX ensures
                        <strong>zero manual intervention</strong> and <strong>zero manual scavenger deaths</strong>.
                        As a result, sanitation safety, dignity of labor, and hygiene standards
                        are significantly improved.

                        Dexter, a humanoid robot capable of motion, also has functional hands.
                        The purpose of the bot is to welcome people.
                        The application of similar bots can be used in fields of photography,
                        cinematography, aiding physically challenged or blind people for their
                        survival, and serving them as a companion.
                        It could also be used as a mascot for inviting chief guests to functions
                        and guest lectures.

                        A specialized robot designed for rescuing children trapped in bore wells is equipped with 
                        advanced technology and precise controls. The primary goal is to minimize injuries during 
                        the rescue operation. The robot is designed for manoeuvring through narrow bore well holes 
                        without depth restrictions. Safety measures are incorporated to protect the child during 
                        the rescue process. Operated manually, the robot includes cameras and sensors to monitor and 
                        sense the operation, ensuring the child's safety and preventing further slipping into the well.
